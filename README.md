CiviCRM Events Views (be.kava.drupal-civicrm_events_views)
==========================================================

This module contains several Drupal views for KAVA: an event calendar as a page and a block, 
a view page for an individual event, and views that show an overview of events a user has
 been registered for or has attended - including an option to cancel their registration.  
   
This is originally a fork of CiviCooP/civicrm_my_event_registrations for the cancellation
functionality, but has since changed quite a lot.
